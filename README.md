# MaterialSortingSystem

The scope of this project was to sort a continuous stream of cylindrical parts of varying materials and colours loaded onto a conveyor belt system. By employing C programming, circuitry, DC motors, and numerous sensors, the goal of the system was to sort 48 objects into the appropriate tray in the shortest amount of time without sacrificing accuracy. Learning outcomes include but are not exclusive to: bit manipulation, interrupts, polling, timers, breadboarding, and debugging.

The project was logically separated into numerous milestones, with each being completed in a logical order of necessity. This allowed for swift identification of a problem, which could be independently addressed and corrected without affecting the entirety of the system.

During the demonstration, the best performance achieved was a time of 34 seconds, while correctly sorting 47 out of 48 objects.
